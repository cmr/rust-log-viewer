rust-log-viewer
===============

[Use it here](http://cmr.github.io/rust-log-viewer/)

This teensy single-page application will slurp in output from the [built-in
logger](http://doc.rust-lang.org/log/index.html) of the
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) standard distribution. It will then colorify
and filter it for you. Very useful when debugging the compiler!
